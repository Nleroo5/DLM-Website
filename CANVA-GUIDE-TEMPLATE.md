# PAGE 2 - THE 3 MISTAKES

## Title at Top:
Stop Making These Expensive Mistakes

## Mistake #1: Targeting Everyone in Your City

**The Problem:**
Most local businesses target "everyone within 25 miles." This wastes money on people who will never buy from you.

**The Fix:**
Start with a 5-10 mile radius. Layer in demographics:
- Age range of your ideal customer
- Household income level
- Specific interests related to your service

**Real Example:**
A dental practice targeting "everyone in Miami" spent $5,000/month with terrible results. We narrowed it to 7 miles, ages 35-60, household income $75k+, interested in cosmetic dentistry. Cost per lead dropped from $180 to $45.

## Mistake #2: Using Boring Ads Nobody Clicks

**The Problem:**
Stock photos and generic text like "We're the best!" don't work. People scroll right past them.

**The Fix:**
Use real people talking to camera. Show before/after results. Tell actual stories.

**The Secret Weapon:**
Actor-led video ads. We have access to 30,000 professional actors who create authentic, scroll-stopping content. These ads get 3x more clicks than static images.

**What Works:**
- 15-30 second videos
- Person speaking directly to camera
- Clear problem and solution
- Strong call-to-action at the end

---

## Mistake #3: Not Tracking Anything

**The Problem:**
Running ads without tracking is like driving blindfolded. You have no idea what's working.

**The Fix:**
Install Meta Pixel on your website (takes 5 minutes). Track these 3 numbers daily:
1. Cost Per Lead
2. Lead Quality (rate each lead 1-10)
3. Return on Ad Spend

**Simple Rule:**
If an ad costs more than 2x your target, kill it. If it's performing well, increase budget by 20%.

## Picture Ideas for Page 2:

- **Middle Section:** Split image - left side shows boring stock photo ad, right side shows real person in video frame talking to camera
- **Bottom Section:** Simple graph showing declining costs or increasing leads (upward arrow)
